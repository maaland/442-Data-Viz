Exploring favouritism in gender imbalanced departments.


There is often talk about how certain departments, for instance Computer Science, have a large imbalance in genders. This sparked the question: "Is the underrepresented gender more likely to be admitted to a gender imbalanced department?" e.g. is a male more likely to be admitted to Psychology, a female dominated major?

The image shows a stacked bar graph, with two vertical bars (male and female) for each department. Each bar has a green section (% of admitted applicants) and a red section (% of rejected applicants). The departments are ordered by descending sparsity of admissions, from left to right. Astronomy (leftmost) has the highest difference between male admissions and female admissions, while Psychology (rightmost) has the lowest.

My findings (on this limited data) were underwhelming, which I suppose is a good thing. I was expecting a large favouritism for men in Psychology, a female dominated department, and a large favouritism for women in Physics, a male dominated department. Interestingly only Astronomy showed a large difference - where you are roughly twice as likely to be admitted if you're female rather than male. As Astronomy is a male dominated department, this answers my original question, but seeing as this is the only department where this is the case, the results are not conclusive.
