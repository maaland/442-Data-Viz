There is often talk about how certain departments, for instance Computer Science, have a large imbalance in genders. This sparked the question: "Is the underrepresented gender more likely to be admitted to a gender imbalanced department?" e.g. is a male more likely to be admitted to Psychology, a female dominated major?

The image shows a stacked bar graph, with two vertical bars (male and female) for each department. Each bar has a green section (% of admitted applicants) and a red section (% of rejected applicants). The departments are ordered by descending sparsity of admissions, from left to right. Astronomy (leftmost) has the highest difference between male admissions and female admissions, while Psychology (rightmost) has the lowest. I decided to go for a stacked bar graph, showing percentages of total counts, to be able to visually compare differences in percentages of admissions between genders, which might have vastly different amounts of applicants. It is easy to see if the dividing line between green and red for one gender is close to the one for the other gender, or not. The coloring will be intuitive for most people - green (admit) is seen as good, while red (reject) is seen as bad. 

Sorting by sparsity of admissions makes it easier to compare different groups to each other. One piece of the data which becomes obscured by this visualization, is the number of applicants. The graph does not tell us how many females applied to Astronomy vs. males, for instance. However, this information is not directly important for the question I am trying to answer. Although, there might be an indirect correlation - perhaps some departments have a certain quota of a certain gender they need to meet. 

My findings (on this limited data) were underwhelming, which I suppose is a good thing. I was expecting a large favouritism for men in Psychology, a female dominated department, and a large favouritism for women in Physics, a male dominated department. Interestingly only Astronomy showed a large difference - where you are roughly twice as likely to be admitted if you're female rather than male. As Astronomy is a male dominated department, this answers my original question, but seeing as this is the only department where this is the case, the results are not conclusive.
